## Overview

### SKU:M145

**Module13.2 QRCode** is a 1D / 2D barcode scanning module in the M5Stack stackable module series. It integrates a 640 x 480 resolution CMOS barcode capture engine and supports three mainstream 2D barcode types and eight 1D barcode types on the market, enabling fast and accurate recognition of barcode information on media such as printouts and labels. By toggling the switch, you can switch between USB and UART communication interfaces for the QR module, allowing external devices to communicate with it. The USB interface can be configured as a USB virtual serial port, USB HID keyboard, or USB HID-POS. The module features a built-in buzzer for audio prompts, illumination and aiming LEDs, and provides rich secondary-development interfaces. It supports multiple scan trigger modes (such as auto mode, continuous mode, motion-sensing mode, pulse mode, etc.) for functional customization and integrated development. The module includes a DC power input port that supports DC 9 ~ 24V input. An internal DC-DC buck circuit supplies power to the entire device, making it suitable for logistics warehousing, retail POS, ticketing systems, production traceability, medical information collection, self-service terminals, and other scenarios.
